geostatsmodels
==============

I am implementing ideas from Clayton V. Deutsch's book Geostatistical Reservoir Modeling in order to better understand geostatistics. I am working through things first in Python in order to prototype things quickly and make sure I understand them. Later I will try to optimize the code for speed.

I used http://people.ku.edu/~gbohling/cpe940 as a starting point to understand kriging. There is also an R package for geostatistics named gstat, but I have not used it yet.
